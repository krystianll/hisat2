/*
 * gzip_reader.h
 *
 * Thin zlib wrapper for streaming (optionally gzip-compressed) read input.
 *
 * Isolated in its own translation unit so that <zlib.h> never leaks into
 * filebuf.h (or anything that includes it): callers see only an opaque
 * handle (void*) and a handful of C-linkage functions.  zlib's gz* API
 * transparently reads BOTH gzip-compressed and plain files, so a single
 * code path replaces the previous "decompress to a temp file first" launcher
 * step -- no multi-GB FASTQ is ever written to disk.
 *
 * Added for the deeptoolsplus bundle; upstream hisat2 has no native gzip
 * support in its read parser (unlike its sibling bowtie2).  The feature is
 * useful on every platform, so it is intentionally NOT #ifdef-guarded.
